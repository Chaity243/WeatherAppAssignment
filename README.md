# WeatherAppAssignment

 A simple app to hit the Open Weather Map API and show the weather based on zip code. 
 
 To run the code take the clone of this repository and import the code on Android Studio and run using the emulator.
 
 In this I have used the 
 
 MVVM architecture,
 Dependecy Injection 
 Databinding etc.
